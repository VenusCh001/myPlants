    <h2>SHITTY DEFINITIONS</h2>
    <STRONG><dt>1. Procrastination:</dt></STRONG>
    <dd>
        The art of delaying tasks until the last possible moment, often accompanied by creative excuses like "I work best under pressure,"
         which is really just code for "I forgot about it."
    </dd> 

    <STRONG><dt>2. Cognitive Dissonance:</dt> </STRONG>
    <dd>That mental gymnastics routine we perform to justify our questionable life choices, 
    like buying another pair of shoes when our closet is already bursting at the seams.</dd>

    <strong><dt>3. Freudian Slip:</dt> </strong>
    <dd>When your subconscious mind decides to play a prank on you by 
        revealing your deepest desires or embarrassing secrets at the most awkward of times, 
        like calling your boss "mom" in a meeting.</dd>
